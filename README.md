# Facemask_Detection_Using_Resnet50
	The project focuses on developing an algorithm for face mask detection using machine learning techniques. The algorithm involves extracting features from images and training various machine-learning models to classify images with and without masks. The project utilizes datasets available on the Kaggle platform and employs the Haar Cascade classifier and Resnet-50, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for detecting faces with masks.
	The project revolves around identifying images of individuals without face masks from a collection of images depicting people with and without masks. To effectively train the machine learning model to distinguish between masked and maskless individuals, the project requires demonstrating the differences between the two categories. Since the images are gathered from devices, some images might have unclear labels, necessitating significant preprocessing efforts. Deep learning techniques from OpenCV, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, and Keras, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are employed to enhance the model's ability to differentiate between masked and maskless individuals.
	In conclusion, the project successfully implements face mask detection using the Resnet-50 model, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99 percent on the provided dataset. The Resnet-50 model's accuracy is attributed to the utilization of Keras and OpenCV libraries, which facilitate efficient model training and image processing.
